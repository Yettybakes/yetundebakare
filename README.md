Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition.

In this project, we will analyze a dataset containing health and dietary information from
individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. The goal is to estimate obesity levels based on physical
condition and eating habits using Python for Data Science. We will apply data cleaning,
exploratory data analysis (EDA), advanced visualizations, and machine learning techniques to
predict obesity levels.
